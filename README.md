**ResQ-Her is an AI-powered solution empowering women in abusive situations with discreet help, mental health support, and legal guidance.**

### üåü Inspiration

Imagine a person trapped in silence, enduring daily fear and abuse, unable to seek help because their every digital move is monitored. Globally, 1 in 3 women experiences violence in her lifetime, and abusers often control and monitor digital communications, cutting off safe avenues for help.

**ResQ-Her** is an innovative AI solution designed to break this silence by providing three crucial, discreet pathways to safety, support, and legal empowerment‚Äîwithout the risk of exposure.

### üí° Core Solutions

#### **1. Discreet SOS Messaging via Steganography**

When making a direct call or sending a text is too dangerous, ResQ-Her provides a covert communication channel.

* **How it Works:** The app uses an LLM (powered by AWS Bedrock) to expand simple keywords (e.g., "help, scared, locked in") into a complete distress message. This message is then encoded using **steganography**‚Äîhidden within an innocent-looking AI-generated image (like a flower or landscape).
* **Safety:** The user shares the visually harmless image on social media. Our system monitors specific channels, decodes the hidden message, and alerts authorities with the structured, prioritized details of the emergency.

#### **2. AI Avatar for Mental Health Support**

Over 80% of women facing abuse are at a higher risk of mental health issues. ResQ-Her provides a confidential, non-judgmental space for emotional recovery.

* **24/7 Confidentiality:** A compassionate, 3D-rendered AI avatar provides immediate mental health support, personalized coping strategies, and relevant resources, ensuring a safe space without the fear of judgment or being overheard.
* **Tailored to Survivors:** The AI is trained to address the unique psychological needs associated with intimate partner violence and trauma.

#### **3. Law Bot with Knowledge of Legal Rights**

Only a fraction of survivors have access to formal legal support. Our Law Bot provides immediate, confidential counsel.

* **Custom Knowledge Base:** The bot is trained on the Indian constitution and other legal documents, stored as vector embeddings in **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search**.
* **Instant Guidance:** Users can ask questions about abuse cases, custody, or property claims, gaining the legal knowledge and confidence to advocate for their rights.
